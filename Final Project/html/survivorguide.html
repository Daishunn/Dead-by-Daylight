        <h1>Survivor Guide</h1>


        <p>As survivor your main goal of a trial is to <span>escape</span></p>


        <p>To be able to escape you have some core objectives that need to be completed in order to escape</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Repair 5 of the 7 generators that spawn around the map</li>
            <li>Don't get caught by the killer 3 times</li>
            <li>Work with your team by saving each other and healing</li>
        </ol>


        <p>
            You have 2 options to escape through the exit gates that are powered when the 5 generators are completed or by jumping into the hatch
            spawns when you're the only survivor left standing.

        </p>

                <h2>Generators</h2>
                <p>As a survivor your main objective is to do 5 of the 7 geneators. Generators take around 90 seconds to complete alone and is faster when you do it with other survivors</p>
                <p>When doing a generator with more than one survivor each survivor gets a 15% speed penatly on the generator thats because doing gens with other survivors is slower than all other survivor spilting up and doing gens seperately.</p>

                <h3>What to do when completely generators</h3>
                
                    <p>Hit all <abbr title="you get skill checks at regular intervals while doing gens">skill checks</p>
                        <p>You'll know when you get a skill check because a sound plays when you're on the gen. If you fail a skill check the generator will regress and lose progress</p>
                    <p>Don't 3 gen yourself and the team and watch if your teammates are about to 3 gen</p>
                        <p>a 3 gen is when theres 1 generator left needed to be completed by the 3 uncompleted gens are all in close proximity with each other</p>
                        <p>Stop regressing generators. Killers have the ability to kick generaotr and cause to regress slowly losing progress.</p>

                            You'll know a killer is blinded when you hear the sound played. It takes about 3 seconds to blind a killer.
